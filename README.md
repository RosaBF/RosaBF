### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rosa! I am currently working as a Backend developer although I started my training as a Frontend. I have a background in the documentary world as a filmmaker and screenwriter and....yet, I have decided to turn my life around and immerse myself into the world of web development! 
I'm loving it and I do belive that in every App, web or desing to apply there is a story to tell in order to get the best user experience  possible.
