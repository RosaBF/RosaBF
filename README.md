### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rosa! I am a Jr.Front-End Developer. I have a background in the documentary world as a filmmaker and screenwriter and....yet, I have decided to turn my life around and immerse myself into the world of web development! 
I'm loving it and I do belive that in every App, web or desing to apply there is a story to tell in order to get the best user experience  possible. 









- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for my first experience as a Jr.Front-End Developer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently securing my last learnings with JS, React, CSS and Back end
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about movies, one of my pasions!
